### DB Tweets

Or how to vacuum a lot of tweets on a specific topic.

It uses both Twitter SEARCH (recursive intervals) and STREAM API.
Tweets are finally inserted into a Neo4j database that you can query in real time.

Please, read and agree the [Twitter Developer Agreement and Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy.html)

### Requirement

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Install

- Create a local directory for the Neo4j database :

```
mkdir /home/user/neo4j
```

- Rename `docker/twitter/src/.env.sample` to `.env` and edit it.
- Update the Neo4j volume path in `docker/docker-compose.yml` according to the directory you created on the previous command


### Run

```
docker-compose rm
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
(or "docker-compose up -d" for daemon mode)
```

Go to :

- http://localhost:7474 for direct access to the Database (login/pass : neo4j/123456)

### Sample Neo4j queries

You just have to copy/past into the Neo4j dashboard :

How many users in database :
```
MATCH (n:User) RETURN COUNT(n)
```

How many tweets :
```
MATCH (n:Tweet) RETURN COUNT(n)
```

App used to post tweets :
```
MATCH (u:User)-[:POSTS|RETWEETS]->(t:Tweet) 
WITH COUNT(t.source) AS nb, t.source AS source 
RETURN source, nb ORDER By nb DESC LIMIT 8
```

Tweets having coordinates :
```
MATCH (u:User)-[:POSTS]->(t:Tweet) 
WHERE t.latitude<>0 AND t.longitude<>0 
RETURN u,t
```

Hashtags and counts :
```
MATCH (h:Hashtag)<-[:TAGS]-(t:Tweet) 
WITH h, COUNT(h) AS nb
ORDER BY nb DESC
RETURN h.text AS text, nb 
LIMIT 15
```

Most shared links :
```
MATCH (t:Tweet)-[r:CONTAINS]->(l:Link) 
WITH l.url AS url,COUNT(r) AS nb 
WHERE nb>1 
RETURN url,nb 
ORDER BY nb DESC
```

Most shared medias :
```
MATCH (t:Tweet) 
WHERE t.media_url<>"" 
RETURN t.media_url AS media, COUNT(t.media_url) AS nb 
ORDER BY nb DESC
```

Most retweeted tweets :
```
MATCH (u:User)-[:POSTS]->(t:Tweet) 
RETURN u.screen_name,t.text,t.retweet_count
ORDER BY t.retweet_count DESC LIMIT 100
```

Top languages of tweets :
```
MATCH (t:Tweet) 
WHERE t.lang<>"und" 
RETURN t.lang AS lng, COUNT(t.lang) AS nb 
LIMIT 10
```

Most active users :
```
MATCH (u:User)-[r:POSTS|RETWEETS]->(t:Tweet)
RETURN u.screen_name AS screen_name,
       COUNT(r) AS nb_tweets,
       u.friends_count AS friends_count,
       u.followers_count AS followers_count
ORDER BY nb_tweets DESC
LIMIT 15
```

Most mentionned users :
```
MATCH (t:Tweet)-[:MENTIONS]->(u:User)
WHERE NOT t.text=~("(?i)^RT @"+u.screen_name+".*")
RETURN  u.screen_name AS screen_name,
        COUNT(u.screen_name) AS count,
        u.friends_count AS friends_count,
        u.followers_count AS followers_count
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 15
```
